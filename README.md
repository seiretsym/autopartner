## Summary
Purpose of this app was to help me automate pairing students in a zoom class. It uses a round robin tournament style algorithm to rotate the students, ensuring that every student will pair with every other student in the class.

## Changes
- Changed the pairing algorithm to round robin tournament style. This ensures that every one gets a chance to pair with everyone.

## Goals
- Improve UI/UX
- Maybe add an account feature to filter data between users
- Add ability to edit Cohort/Student names

## Current Features
- Create a Cohort
- Add/Remove students to a Cohort's roster as needed
- Pair Students and Save their current pairing for display on homepage
- Allow user to select which cohort to view/modify
- Delete a Cohort

## Learning Experience
- Learned more about Vue
- Learned to cascade delete db entries with Mongoose using hooks
- Learned to deploy a MEVN stack to Heroku.
