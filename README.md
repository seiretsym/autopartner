## Summary
Purpose of this app was to help me automate pairing students in a zoom class. It has some algorithms that attempts to pairs students with people they haven't paired with before.

## Goals
- Improve the Pairing Algorithm
- Improve UI/UX
- Maybe add an account feature to filter data between users
- Add ability to edit Cohort/Student names

## Current Features
- Create a Cohort
- Add/Remove students to a Cohort's roster as needed
- Pair Students and Save their current pairing for display on homepage
- Allow user to select which cohort to view/modify
- Delete a Cohort

## Learning Experience
- Learned more about Vue
- Learned to cascade delete db entries with Mongoose using hooks
- Learned to deploy a MEVN stack to Heroku.
