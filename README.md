## Summary
Purpose of this app was to help me automate pairing students in a zoom class. It uses a round robin tournament style algorithm to rotate the students, ensuring that every student will pair with every other student in the class.

## Changes
- Added an account feature
- Only the owner of a cohort can delete it
- Only the owner of a cohort can add/remove students from it
- Only the owner of a cohort can arrange pairings in it
- Instructors now have the option to join other cohorts, so they can view the pair arrangement for that cohort

## Goals
- Add feature to edit Cohort/Student names

## Current Features
- Create an account
- Create a Cohort
- Join/Leave Cohorts
- Add/Remove students to a Cohort's roster as needed
- Pair Students and Save their current pairing for display on homepage
- Allow user to select which cohort to view/modify
- Delete a Cohort
- Round Robin Tournament Style Pairing Algorithm

## Learning Experience
- Learned more about Vue
- Learned to cascade delete db entries with Mongoose using hooks
- Learned to deploy a MEVN stack to Heroku.
